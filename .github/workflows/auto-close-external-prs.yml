            const message = `Thank you so much for your interest in ControlR! I really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.

            However, I am not accepting PRs at the moment for the following reasons:

            **Read-Only Mirror**
            For now, the public repository is a read-only mirror. This allows me to work on ideas and experiments in private and only reveal them when they're ready.

            **Legal and Financial Considerations**
            With Remotely, I found out that there are legal impliciations to accepting external contributions.  Since I'm now depending on ControlR to be my primary source of income, it's less complicated and risky if I avoid external contributions for now.

            **Personal Working Style**
            During these early stages of the project, working solo will bring me the most amount of happiness and sense of accomplishment.  It will allow me to move quickly and maintain a clear vision.  I hope you understand!

            I will begin accepting external contributions once ControlR reaches a more mature state and is financially self-sustaining.

            If you have ideas, suggestions, or found a bug, please feel free to open an issue instead. I'd love to hear your feedback!

            Thank you again for your interest in the project! 🙏`;
